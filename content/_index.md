# Learning Techniques

This is my work for the third weeks assignment of the
[Learning How to Learning course](http://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/)
taught by Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski.

This work is up to how I understood what I learned at the course. It does not
claim to be complete and or scientifically correct, although I tried my best.
The main effort was to

1. structure the material
2. rephrase the material in my own words.

The structure I came up with distinguishes three parts:

#### The Brain

This part explains how your brain works. I left out the chemistry and biology, because I
don't think it is necessary for the learning process. But it is important to
know how your mind works and what it is capable of doing.

#### The Resources

Things in this category are your fuel. Without them, your efforts won't work.

#### The Tools

This part comprises all the techniques to effectively alter your habits, leading hopefully
to better learning results and in the end, a more pleasant life.

Improvements are welcome.  You can either do so by
[creating an issue](https://github.com/stolpeo/learning-techniques/issues)
or [forking the repository](https://github.com/stolpeo/learning-techniques/).

Cheers, Oliver
