Accomplishing a task can be done in two ways:

- **process-oriented** or
- **product-oriented**

When you focus on the outcome (product), this seems to put more stress on you
as when you focus on the process of accomplishing the product. It is more likely
that you will get into a [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology))
and dodge procrastination.

As Jesus/Konfuzius said: ***The journey is the reward.***

#### How-To

1. Look at the actual work that needs to be done to accomplish the product
2. Use the [pomodoro technique]({{< relref "tools/pomodoro" >}}) to focus on
   the work

#### What For

* Getting into the flow
* Avoid procrastination
