[Chunks]({{< relref "brain/memory" >}}) are compact packages of information
that are easy accessible for the mind. They are part of the **bigger picture**
that you want to form, but easier to grasp for the [focused mind]({{< relref
"brain/mind" >}}). Chunking is the technique to form chunks and to connect them.

#### How-To

1. Break your big picture down into managable tasks. It is important to
   understand the big picture!
2. Alternate between the following two:
  - Practice these tasks in **focused mode** using [pomodoro technique]({{< relref
    "tools/pomodoro" >}}) and [spaced repetition]({{< relref
    "tools/spaced_repetition" >}}).
  - Use **[diffuse mode]({{< relref "brain/mind" >}})** and [sleep]({{< relref
    "resources/sleep" >}}) to connect chunks. Have the big picture in mind!
