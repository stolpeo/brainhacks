#### Description

Spaced repetition helps you to store things in your [long term memory]({{<
relref "brain/memory" >}}). It is more efficient to repeat things for a
shorter time every or every few days rather than practice one time for a longer
time period. A [pomodoro]({{< relref "tools/pomodoro">}}) each day is better
than binge learning!

#### How-To

1. Define your practice routine for the item you want to store permanently
2. Make a timetable over one or more weeks where you schedule, say, a pomodoro
   a day for the first days and then a pomodoro every few days with incrementing
   spaces.
3. Stick to the timetable and practice ;-)

#### What For

* Storing things in long term memory
