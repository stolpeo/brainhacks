Recalling is a method where you test yourself about the things you just
learned. It should prevent you from the illusion of competence, a pitfall where
you think you are an expert in a field by having read books about that field
but you didn't do any problem solving yourself.

#### How-To

1. Learn or read an item or paragraph
2. Try to test yourself about what you just learned

#### What For

* Avoid illusion of competence
