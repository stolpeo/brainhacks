The memory palace technique helps you building groups of unrelated things to be
stored together. Once grouped together, they just occupy one slot of your
working memory. The underlying assumption is, that the mind can remember images
better than anything else because from an evolutionary point of view we are
build for remembering paths for orientation.

#### How-to

1. Imagine a large house that you know by heart
2. Place the items you want to remember in the rooms. The funnier the placement
   is, the more memorable it is.
3. Walk through the house and recall the items by passing those places.
4. Walk through the house a few times

#### 

* Quickly memorize unrelated things
