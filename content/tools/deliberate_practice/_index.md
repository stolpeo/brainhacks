In deliberate practice one focuses on the task that is practiced and seeks
always to improve the skill he is working on. This means that once one gets
comfortable with a level that he pushes himself to go for the next level. This
is different to normal practice which could include mindless repetitions and
repeating what you already learned. Deliberate practice is more exhausting but
leads quicker to better learning results.

#### How-To

1. Break the goal down in smaller tasks
2. Work focused on practicing those tasks
3. Get feedback, revise your results
4. Find your weaknesses and how to address them
5. Incorporate this into your training schedule and go to 2.
