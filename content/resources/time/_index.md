Time is a precious resource. To make the best use of your time, schedule the
time you want to focus, e.g. by using the [pomodoro technique]({{< relref
"tools/pomodoro" >}}) as well as the breaks. Also don't forget to schedule the
finishing time for the day. Setting this small deadline will help you to focus
and get things done.
