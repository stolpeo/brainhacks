First of all: **You can learn a lot of things**, even things that you think are
out of your field of competence. Having a high motivation for what you want to
learn makes things much more easy for you. When you are not into what you want
to learn, you might have a hard time. But be aware, not everybody is fond of a
task all the time, even it is part of the big picture. This means, don't expect
to be fully motivated for every task. The importance is to keep going, to be
patient with yourself and to have the **big picture** in mind. Not everybody
learns at the same pace, but this does not mean that you can't accomplish
something.
