#### Working Memory

The working memory (or short term memory) holds what you are currently
processing. The items stored in this memory are there only temporarily and can
be pushed away when you want to store other information. Those memories vanish
quickly and you have to repeat them to keep them in your working memory.
Scientists assume that you have **four slots** where you can store items. Those
items can also be chunks.  **Chunks** are compact packages of information that
are easy accessible for the mind. They are parts of a **bigger picture**, and you
can connect them, which gets easier the more of them you have. See also how to
[form chunks]({{< relref "tools/new_skill/chunking" >}}).

#### Long Term Memory

The long term memory is your brains warehouse. It is huge and the course
doesn't even mention an upper limit of what it can store. It takes some time
and [practice]({{< relref "tools/new_skill/spaced_repetition">}}) to bring things into
the long term memory (**consolidation**). Once an item or chunk is in your long
term memory, you can recall into your working memory. Be aware! Those items will
be **reconsolidated** to your long term memory and can be altered. Thus, your
memories *live*.
