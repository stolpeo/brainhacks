Your mind and thinking is either in **focused mode** or in **diffuse mode**.
It can't be in the two at the same time. Alternating between them is an
important thing during learning. Forcing yourself to stay in the focused mode
for too long won't give you better results than when you regularly switch to
the diffuse mode.

#### Focused Mode

In the focused mode, your mind is fully focused on **one** task. Your thinking
and problem solving follow familiar ways, around solutions that you might have
solved before and that are stored in your memory. You are working on the
**details** of your big picture. Staying in focused mode for too long won't
result in better results

#### Diffuse Mode

In the diffuse mode, your mind seems to be turned off. Instead of focusing on a
thing, you are doing something mindless, e.g. a simple physical tasks like
cleaning or running. Your subconsciousness however will keep on working. If you
are in the diffuse mode, you give yourself the possibility to access
[chunks]({{< relref "brain/memory" >}}) that not seem to be related to what you
were working on but that might help you to come up with a **creative solution**.
In the diffuse mode, you are looking at the **big picture**.
