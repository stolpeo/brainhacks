Habits have the following structure:

##### 1. Cue

This triggers the whole habit. For example if you leave your house you will
most likely lock the door. Probably you won't even think about that.

##### 2. Routine

After being triggered, you go into zombie mode and the routine will kick off.
In our example you will lock the door.

##### 3. Reward

You will be rewarded with a good feeling. In our case you will be rewarded with
a warm feeling that your house is secure.

##### 4. Belief

This is important. You should belief in that your habit is doing a good thing
to you.

#### Procrastination

Procrastination is a **bad habit**. When you want to learn something where the
reward is not in quick sight, your brain interprets that as **pain** and goes
for something that is pleasant and with immediate reward. Good news is:
