Forcing yourself to stay in the focused mode for too long won\u0026rsquo;t give you better results than when you regularly switch to the diffuse mode.\nFocused Mode In the focused mode, your mind is fully focused on one task. Your thinking and problem solving follow familiar ways, around solutions that you might have solved before and that are stored in your memory. You are working on the details of your big picture. Staying in focused mode for too long won\u0026rsquo;t result in better results\nDiffuse Mode In the diffuse mode, your mind seems to be turned off. Instead of focusing on a thing, you are doing something mindless, e.g. a simple physical tasks like cleaning or running. Your subconsciousness however will keep on working. If you are in the diffuse mode, you give yourself the possibility to access chunks that not seem to be related to what you were working on but that might help you to come up with a creative solution. In the diffuse mode, you are looking at the big picture.\n"

The items stored in this memory are there only temporarily and can be pushed away when you want to store other information. Those memories vanish quickly and you have to repeat them to keep them in your working memory. Scientists assume that you have four slots where you can store items. Those items can also be chunks. Chunks are compact packages of information that are easy accessible for the mind. They are parts of a bigger picture, and you can connect them, which gets easier the more of them you have. See also how to form chunks.\nLong Term Memory The long term memory is your brains warehouse. It is huge and the course doesn\u0026rsquo;t even mention an upper limit of what it can store. It takes some time and practice to bring things into the long term memory (consolidation). Once an item or chunk is in your long term memory, you can recall into your working memory. Be aware! Those items will be reconsolidated to your long term memory and can be altered. Thus, your memories live.\n"

It does not claim to be complete and or scientifically correct, although I tried my best. The main effort was to\n structure the material rephrase the material in my own words.  The structure I came up with distinguishes three parts:\nThe Brain This part explains how your brain works. I left out the chemistry and biology, because I don\u0026rsquo;t think it is necessary for the learning process. But it is important to know how your mind works and what it is capable of doing.\nThe Resources Things in this category are your fuel. Without them, your efforts won\u0026rsquo;t work.\nThe Tools This part comprises all the techniques to effectively alter your habits, leading hopefully to better learning results and in the end, a more pleasant life.\nImprovements are welcome.
